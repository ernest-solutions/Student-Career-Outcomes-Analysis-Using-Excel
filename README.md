## Objectives and Analysis Questions

The main objective of this project is to analyze factors influencing student career outcomes.

**Analysis Questions:**

1. Does academic performance (GPA and SAT score) influence the number of job offers received?
2. How do internships and completed projects affect starting salary?
3. Are there differences in career outcomes across fields of study?
4. Do soft skills and networking scores relate to career satisfaction?
5. What factors are associated with faster promotion timelines?
6. Is there a relationship between work-life balance and career satisfaction?
7. Are students with certifications more likely to receive higher salaries or job levels?

## Data Understanding

The dataset contains **400 records and 19 variables**, including numerical and categorical data covering demographics, academics, skills, and career outcomes. Initial review focused on identifying data types, checking for duplicates, and assessing potential missing values or inconsistencies.

---

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning was performed in Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency. The original dataset was preserved in a **Raw Data** worksheet, while all cleaning operations were conducted in a separate **Clean Data** worksheet.

Duplicate checks using `Student_ID` found no duplicate records. All columns were reviewed for missing values, and no blanks were identified. Data types were verified, column names standardized, and consistent formatting applied across numerical and categorical fields. The dataset was confirmed to be well-structured and suitable for analysis.

---

## Data Analysis

The cleaned dataset was analyzed using **pivot tables**, **sorting**, and **filtering** in Excel. Basic Excel functions including **SUM**, **AVERAGE**, **COUNT**, and **IF** were applied to compute summary statistics and support comparisons.

Pivot tables were created to analyze relationships between academic performance, internships, skills, certifications, and key career outcomes such as job offers, starting salary, career satisfaction, and promotion timelines. Each analysis was directly aligned with the objectives defined in Step 2.

## STEP 6 — Data Visualization (Dashboard)

An Excel dashboard was created to visually communicate the most important insights from the analysis. Selected pivot tables were converted into charts with clear titles and consistent formatting. The dashboard highlights key relationships, including academic performance and job offers, field of study and salary, internships and salary outcomes, and job level and promotion timelines.

## Insights and Recommendations

### Key Insights 

The analysis and dashboard visualizations reveal clear relationships between academic, experiential, and skill-based factors and early career outcomes. Students with higher university GPA levels received a greater number of job offers, indicating a strong positive relationship between academic performance and employability. This trend becomes more pronounced at higher GPA ranges, suggesting that academic excellence significantly improves job market competitiveness.

**Internship experience** was found to be one of the strongest predictors of **starting salary**. The dashboard shows a steady increase in average starting salary as the number of **internships completed** increases, with students completing multiple internships earning substantially higher salaries than those with little or no internship experience.

**Career outcomes** also varied across **fields of study**. Disciplines such as Business, Engineering, and Computer Science recorded higher student representation and stronger salary-related outcomes compared to some other fields, indicating that field of study plays a role in shaping early career earnings.

Analysis of **career progression** showed that **job level** is associated with **promotion timelines**. Senior-level positions were linked to shorter average years to promotion, while entry-level roles required longer periods for advancement. This suggests that early career positioning influences long-term progression speed.

In addition, students with stronger soft skills and networking abilities reported higher levels of career satisfaction, and better work-life balance was associated with increased satisfaction. These findings highlight that non-academic factors contribute meaningfully to overall career success.

## Key Recommendations

Based on the findings from the analysis and dashboard, the following recommendations are proposed:

**For Students**

Students should strive to balance strong academic performance with practical experience. While maintaining a high GPA improves employability, actively pursuing internships and certifications can significantly enhance starting salary and long-term career prospects.

**For Educational Institutions**

Institutions should strengthen partnerships with industry to expand internship and experiential learning opportunities. Embedding internship programs, project-based learning, and certification pathways into academic curricula can better prepare students for the job market.

**For Career Advisors and Program Coordinators**

Greater emphasis should be placed on soft skills development, networking, and career readiness training. These factors were shown to influence career satisfaction and should be integrated into career guidance programs.

**For Policy Makers and Education Planners**

Policies aimed at improving access to internships, skills training, and certification programs—especially for students in lower-performing or underrepresented fields—may help reduce inequalities in career outcomes.

**Overall, the findings suggest that while academic performance is important, practical experience, skills development, and certifications play a critical role in shaping career outcomes. Educational institutions should encourage internship participation, skills training, and certification programs to better prepare students for the job market. Students are also advised to balance academic achievement with experiential learning and personal skill development to improve career satisfaction and advancement prospects**
